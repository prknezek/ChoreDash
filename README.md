# ChoreDash

## Overview
ChoreDash is a 2D game developed in Python using the pygame library for the Capsher 2023 ACC Coding Challenge. It's a simple game where the player attempts to finish all of the tasks assigned to them within the time limit.

While taking a nice peaceful nap, you get a text message from your mom. Without even looking at your phone, you realize what you have done wrong that could possibly ruin your nap time and all future nap times...ever. 

YOU FORGOT TO DO THE CHORES!<br>
HURRY UP AND GET THEM DONE BEFORE YOUR MOM GETS HOME!
